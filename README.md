Watts is a set of commands for quickly preparing Lumen based micro-services. With single commands create full API based CRUDS with simple service layer structures.

## Requirements

1. PHP 5.5.9+
2. OpenSSL
3. Laravel 5.1+

### Composer
Start a new Laravel project:
```php
composer create-project laravel/lumen your-project-name
```

Then run the following to add Watts
```php
composer require "yab/watts"
```

### Providers
Add this to the `bootsrap/app.php` in the service providers array:
```php
Yab\Watts\WattsProvider::class
```

### Uncomment!
Taylor Otwell has very kindly left the `bootstrap/app.php` with a handful of parts commented out, which can be easily uncommented. Doing so will enable the authentication layer of Lumen. For more information click on the documentation link below.

Some of the things you will want to uncomment are:
```php
$app->withFacades();
$app->withEloquent();

$app->routeMiddleware([
    'auth' => App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
]);

$app->register(App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class);
$app->register(App\Providers\AuthServiceProvider::class);
$app->register(App\Providers\EventServiceProvider::class);
```

You can test run with an existing database using the standard User table structure. All you would need to do is add an `api_token` column to the user table. Or, you could switch it for the suggestion provided by the `watts:generate` command. Either way you'll hit the ground running!

## Lumen Documentation
Please consult the documentation here: [http://lumen.laracogs.com/docs](http://lumen.laracogs.com/docs)

## Commands
The console commands provided by Watts are as follows:

### api
----
The api command will provide a unique API_KEY which can be used for authenticating API calls. This is particularily useful for making anonymous micro-service apps.

```php
php artisan watts:api
```

### prepare
----
The prepare action will prepare you micro-service to have a test database connection and allow functionality of the unit tests generated by the CRUD and TABLE CRUD.

```php
php artisan watts:prepare
```

##### crud
The CRUD will generate a Controller, Service, Repository, Model, Migration and some unit tests for the table specified in your command. You can specify the schema or modify that later if you want.

```php
php artisan watts:crud {table} {--migration} {--schema=}
```

##### table-crud
The table CRUD will review the table in your database and build a CRUD around it. Making it very easy to migrate a task to a micro-service.

```php
php artisan watts:table-crud {table} {--migration}
```
